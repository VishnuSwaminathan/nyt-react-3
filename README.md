# New York Times React App

This is a NYT scraper application, that has an input form to insert a topic of your choice, the start and end dates of the articles you want to see, and then just press search! There's even a function to save articles if you would like.

## How To Run Locally

- Install all dependencies
- Type: "npm start" in your CLI
- That's it!

## Technologies Used

- Node.js
- Express.js
- Mongoose.js
- Axios

### Note:

I plan to incorporate various other news sources, so that one can choose from any number of sources, and possibly a section to comment/rate the articles.
